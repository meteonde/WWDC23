# Hello! I'm Matheus Souza, a Design student. Since early on, my intuition has been my guide. With an interest in the myths and legends of my Amazonian culture, I decided to study tarot and combine these two passions into a unique experience called The Enchanted Oracle. I believe our intuition can be a powerful ally in crucial moments of our lives. So, take a deep breath, open your mind, and come with me on this little journey. I'm excited to share this experience with you!
